<h1 align="center">Hey there 👋, I'm Abdessamad <br/><sub>(<em>Samadi-sudo</em>)</sub></h1>
<p align="center">
  <strong>MIP Student (Math, Computer Science, Physics)</strong><br/>
  I believe that knowledge is a universal gift that belongs to everyone. By bridging the gap between 
  mathematical theory and AI-driven robotics, I build tools that automate the mundane(Routine) not just for 
  efficiency, but to give people back their most precious resource: <strong>time for what truly matters in life.</strong>

## About ​💭​

I am a MIP student at FSR Rabat and a student at 42 School (1337 Rabat – UM6P), with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, robotics, and embedded systems. My approach combines solid mathematical foundations with hands-on, project-based learning.

I am comfortable working on embedded systems and robotics projects, building AI-driven solutions primarily with Python, and using C++ for competitive programming and performance-critical tasks. I also have experience in game development using the Godot engine, creating prototypes and gameplay systems. I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing solutions, and continuously pushing my technical boundaries through real-world challenges.

## Skills 🦅

### Programming Languages
- **Python** : AI, automation, data-driven projects, 42 projects  
- **C / C++** : embeded systems programming, competitive programming, 42 projects  
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** : still learning not a professional yet..., i use them when a project need a platform on the web to make it user friendly, or in web dev competion
- **GDscript** : only using it on godot when i participate in a game jam or i need to show a working prototype to see if it's good before starting working on the real deal

### Frontend & Web
- **HTML, CSS** -> responsive layouts and UI prototyping  
- **React (with TypeScript)** -> component-based UIs (familiar, not expert)

### Artificial Intelligence
- Machine learning fundamentals  
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** -> experimentation and prototyping

### Embedded Systems & Robotics
- **Arduino, ESP32, rasbery pi** -> sensor integration, low-level control, hardware–software interaction, everything i need to make my project alive

### Game Development
- **Godot Engine** -> gameplay systems and prototyping

### Development Tools
- **Git & GitHub**  
- **Linux** (daily driver)
