<h1 align="center">Hey there 👋, I'm Abdessamad <br/><sub>(<em>Samadi-sudo</em>)</sub></h1>
<p align="center">
  <strong>MIP Student (Math, Computer Science, Physics)</strong><br/>
  I believe that knowledge is a universal gift that belongs to everyone. By bridging the gap between 
  mathematical theory and AI-driven robotics, I build tools that automate the mundane(Routine) not just for 
  efficiency, but to give people back their most precious resource: <strong>time for what truly matters in life.</strong>

## About ​💭​

I am a MIP student at FSR Rabat and a student at 42 School (1337 Rabat – UM6P), with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, robotics, and embedded systems. My approach combines solid mathematical foundations with hands-on, project-based learning.

I am comfortable working on embedded systems and robotics projects, building AI-driven solutions primarily with Python, and using C++ for competitive programming and performance-critical tasks. I also have experience in game development using the Godot engine, creating prototypes and gameplay systems. I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing solutions, and continuously pushing my technical boundaries through real-world challenges.
